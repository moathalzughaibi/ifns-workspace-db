# Stock Indicator System — Phase 3 L1 Indicator Catalog
Version: v0.1 (Draft)

## 1. Purpose

This Phase 3 document defines the **authoritative L1 Indicator Catalog** for the Stock Indicator System
under IFNS. It takes the **universe draft** from Phase 2 and promotes a subset of **Tier 0 (and selected
Tier 1) L1 indicators** into a structured, implementation-ready catalog.

The aims of this phase are:

- To define **precise inputs and outputs** for each L1 indicator.
- To provide **formula-level pseudocode** so engineering teams can implement them consistently across
  languages and platforms.
- To specify **default parameters and timeframes** for each indicator.
- To specify **primary ML roles** (feature, context, risk) for each indicator.
- To prepare a foundation for:
  - Phase 4: composite (L2/L3) frameworks that build on these L1 blocks.
  - Phase 5: feature output schema (actual feature columns).

This catalog is stored as both:

- A human-readable Markdown spec (this file).
- A machine-usable CSV file: `sync/ifns/indicators_catalog_L1.csv` (Phase 3 artifact).

## 2. Scope and Selection Policy

### 2.1 In-Scope for Phase 3

This Phase includes **L1 indicators only**, primarily:

- All **Tier 0** L1 indicators from the Phase 2 universe.
- Selected **Tier 1** L1 indicators that are common, simple, and useful across many strategies.

These span all 9 families:

1. Trend & Price Location
2. Momentum & Strength
3. Volatility & Range
4. Volume / Flow / Liquidity
5. Market Structure & Geometry
6. Candle Grammar & Micro-Patterns
7. Valuation & Fundamentals
8. Event & Regime
9. Risk & Exposure

### 2.2 Out-of-Scope (Future Phases)

- All **L2** and **L3** indicators (transforms and frameworks) — handled in **Phase 4**.
- Detailed feature column definitions (value/state/event columns) — handled in **Phase 5**.
- ML-based pattern detectors and embeddings — defined at the indicator level in Phase 4, implemented
  and versioned as models separately.

## 3. Catalog Schema (L1)

The L1 catalog is stored as a CSV table with the following columns:

| Column name             | Type   | Description |
|-------------------------|--------|-------------|
| `indicator_id`          | string | Stable ID (e.g., `rsi_14`, `sma_20`). |
| `name`                  | string | Human-readable name. |
| `family_role_primary`   | string | Primary family (Trend & Price Location, Momentum & Strength, etc.). |
| `family_role_secondary` | string | Optional secondary family. |
| `universe_tier`         | int    | Tier from Phase 2 (0 core, 1 strong candidate, 2 exploratory). |
| `digitization_level`    | enum   | For L1 always `formula`. |
| `inputs`                | string | High-level data domains required (e.g., `price`, `volume`, `fundamental`, `events`, `portfolio`). |
| `required_fields`       | string | Concrete fields required (e.g., `close,high,low,volume`). |
| `default_params`        | string | JSON-style parameters (e.g., `{ "window": 14 }`). |
| `default_timeframes`    | string | JSON-style list of timeframes (e.g., `["1h","1d"]`). |
| `output_type_primary`   | enum   | scalar, oscillator, category, flag. |
| `formula_pseudocode`    | string | Short pseudocode describing the formula. |
| `ml_role_primary`       | enum   | feature, context, risk, filter, label. |
| `ml_role_secondary`     | string | Additional roles, if any. |
| `feature_outputs_default` | string | JSON-style description of expected feature outputs (e.g. `{ "value": true, "state": false }`). |
| `notes_phase3`          | string | Implementation or usage notes. |

This schema is intentionally compact but expressive enough to be:

- Directly imported into Notion databases.
- Used by an engineering generator (e.g., templating) to produce code skeletons.
- Referenced by Phase 5 when defining feature output schemas.

## 5. Example Formula Pseudocode

To illustrate the level of detail in the CSV, here are a few pseudocode examples.

### 5.1 RSI(14) — `rsi_14`

- **Inputs:** `close`
- **Params:** `window = 14`
- **Pseudocode:**

```text
delta_t = close_t - close_{t-1}
gain_t  = max(delta_t, 0)
loss_t  = max(-delta_t, 0)

avg_gain_t = EMA(gain, window)
avg_loss_t = EMA(loss, window)

rs_t  = avg_gain_t / max(avg_loss_t, epsilon)
rsi_t = 100 - 100 / (1 + rs_t)
```

- **Output:** oscillator in [0,100].

### 5.2 ATR(14) — `atr_14`

- **Inputs:** `high, low, close` (and previous `close`).
- **Params:** `window = 14`
- **Pseudocode:**

```text
tr_t = max(
    high_t - low_t,
    abs(high_t - close_{t-1}),
    abs(low_t  - close_{t-1})
)

atr_t = SMA(tr, window)  # or Wilder's smoothing variant

```

- **Output:** scalar in [0,1].

## 6. CSV Artifact: `indicators_catalog_L1.csv`

The CSV file accompanying this document contains one row per L1 indicator with all the columns
defined in Section 3. It is expected to be:

- Stored in GitHub under: `sync/ifns/indicators_catalog_L1.csv`.
- Synced into Notion for Admin / governance views.
- Consumed by Phase 5 when deriving feature output schemas.

**Note:**

- Adding new L1 indicators should always go through this catalog.
- Any change to `indicator_id`, formula semantics, or default parameters must be versioned and
  reviewed (e.g., moving from `rsi_14` to `rsi_14_v2` if semantics change).

## 7. Handover Notes for Phase 3

For a new engineer or agent:

1. Use this document to understand the **L1 universe** and the catalog schema.
2. Use `indicators_catalog_L1.csv` as the **single source of truth** for L1 definitions.
3. Implement indicators according to:
   - `inputs`
   - `required_fields`
   - `default_params`
   - `formula_pseudocode`
4. Expose outputs to the feature engineering layer according to:
   - `output_type_primary`
   - `feature_outputs_default`

After Phase 3 is accepted as baseline, Phase 4 will extend this work to L2/L3 frameworks
and pattern systems that depend on these L1 building blocks.
