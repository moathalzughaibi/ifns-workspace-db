# Phase 3 — L1 Catalog: Readiness Checklist
Date: 2025-11-18

**Exit criteria**
- Each L1 indicator has exact semantics (formula, windows, parameters, bounds, units).
- Inputs specified (OHLCV fields, corporate actions, calendars), time alignment defined.
- Edge-case handling documented (zero volume, splits, bad ticks, missing bars).
- Symbol/exchange generalization clear; configurable parameters have ranges and defaults.
- Test vectors included (mini CSVs) and pass; review sign-off recorded.
- L1 CSV & Markdown are consistent; IDs stable and unique.
