# Phase 5 — Feature Output & Digitization: Readiness Checklist
Date: 2025-11-18

**Exit criteria**
- Final feature columns locked (whitelist), types & dtypes assigned, scaling/binning chosen.
- Leakage tests and alignment rules validated (close_time, lookahead safe).
- NA policy, coverage thresholds, drift monitors, and value ranges encoded in manifests.
- Per-feature clip policy defined; context labels validated (cardinality, dominance).
- Reproducibility: manifests have hash pins and exact column order.
- H1/D1 co-existence documented; no ID collisions.
