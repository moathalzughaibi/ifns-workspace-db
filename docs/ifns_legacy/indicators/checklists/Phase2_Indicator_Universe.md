Date: 2025-11-18

**Exit criteria**
- Universe list is exhaustive across families and timeframes (D1/H1), with rationale per entry.
- Columns complete: id, group/family, formula idea, notes, status (candidate/keep/drop), reference links.
- Duplicates merged, aliases resolved, conflicting definitions removed.
- Pre-screen criteria applied (data availability, computational feasibility, license constraints).
- Traceability: each dropped item has reason; each kept item mapped to L1 candidate(s).
