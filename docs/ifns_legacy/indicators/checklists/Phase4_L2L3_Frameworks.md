Date: 2025-11-18

**Exit criteria**
- Composition logic formalized (weights, gates, thresholds, regime conditioning).
- Conflict handling defined (MR vs Breakout precedence, tie-breakers).
- Sensitivity analysis and backtest sanity (not full research) show usefulness.
- Context integration points defined (trend state, structure bins, candle grammar).
- Deployability: parameters externalized; variant matrix per exchange/timeframe drafted.
- Documentation links to L1 dependencies; interpretability notes captured.
