# IFNS – UI Master Drafts & Working Notes

This page acts as a **running log** of drafts, refinements, and open questions related to the IFNS – UI Master specs.
It is intentionally lightweight and table-driven so it can be synced between Git and Notion.

> **Usage**
> - Each row is a **work item** or **discussion thread**.
> - Use `Status` to track whether the note is still active.
> - Use `Linked File / Page` to connect to the relevant Step/Stage spec or Notion page.

## 1. Drafts & Working Notes Log

| ID | Date (YYYY-MM-DD) | Area                      | Summary                                                     | Linked File / Page                                         | Status    | Notes |
|----|-------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-------|
| 1  | 2025-11-17        | Steps 01–14 (Phase 1)     | Initial full draft of all 14 Step specs completed (v0.6).   | docs/ifns/Step_01_… to Step_14_….md                        | Closed   | Baseline narrative in place; future refinements via PRs. |
| 2  | 2025-11-17        | Phase 2 – Index & Summary | Created Steps Index, UI Master Summary, and Drafts log.     | docs/ifns/IFNS_UI_Steps_Index.md                           | Open     | Keep this page updated as new work items are added.      |
| 3  | 2025-11-17        | Stage Specs (Phase 3)     | Plan to generate Stage 00–07 specs and sync to Notion.      | (planned) docs/ifns/Stage_00_… to Stage_07_….md            | Planned  | To start after Phase 2 confirmed in Git & Notion.        |

You can extend this table over time with additional rows, for example:

- Specific refinements to a given Step (e.g., “Deepen Implementation Reference for Step 07 – DIL”).
- Decisions about SxE console naming and grouping.
- Open questions about how to represent certain KPIs or telemetry contracts.

## 2. Conventions

- Keep IDs **stable** once assigned — do not reuse.
- Prefer **short, action-focused summaries**.
- When work is finished, move `Status` from `Open` or `Planned` to `Closed` and briefly note the outcome.
- Larger decisions should eventually be reflected in:
  - The relevant Step spec (01–14),
  - The relevant Stage spec (0–7),
  - And, if needed, in a dedicated decision log (e.g., IFNS Decisions Log in your broader Autopilot setup).

This page is meant to be a **living companion** to the more formal specs, capturing how the IFNS – UI Master evolves over time.
