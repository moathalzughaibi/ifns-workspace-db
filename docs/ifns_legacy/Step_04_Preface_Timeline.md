# Step 04 – Preface Timeline: Evolutionary Arc

## 01 – Narrative & Intent

This step sets the **evolutionary arc** for IFNS: how the system grows from early experiments into a governed, live, continuously learning financial nerve system. It gives time structure to the vision—describing *phases* and *milestones*—so that IFNS is not just a target architecture but a **trajectory**.

The intent is to answer three questions:

1. **Where do we start?**
   What is the minimum viable nucleus of IFNS (data, models, backtests, SxE) that can exist offline?

2. **How do we progress safely?**
   What intermediate stages (paper, canary, controlled live) must we pass through, and what evidence is required at each stage?

3. **How do we keep evolving?**
   Once IFNS is live, how does it continue to learn, update policies, and add new capabilities without losing stability or traceability?

This timeline is not about calendar dates; it is about **capability phases**. Each phase corresponds to one or more concrete stages in the Core ML Build plan, and each has clear entry/exit criteria so we always know *where we are* on the journey.

### 1. Phase 0 – Conceptualization & Integration of Thought

In Phase 0, IFNS exists primarily as a **conceptual, integrated specification**:

- The 14-step Integrated specification is drafted and refined.
- The main intelligence layers (DIL, MI, EI, MSA, MSI, DRA, SEL, SxE) are defined and linked.
- The roles of Mirror, Admin, the Core ML engine, and Telemetry are articulated.
- Key questions, edge cases, and design tensions are surfaced and resolved at the narrative level.

Deliverables of Phase 0:

- A coherent **Integrated IFNS document** (the 14 steps).
- Alignment on the **system-to-experience philosophy** and the idea of IFNS as a financial “nerve system” rather than just a trading engine.
- Agreement on the **Seven-Step Master Plan** as the implementation backbone.

Phase 0 ends when the conceptual design is stable enough that implementing the Core ML build plan no longer feels like guessing.

### 2. Phase 1 – Foundations & Offline Core (Stages 1–3)

Phase 1 brings IFNS into existence as a **fully offline Core ML engine**. At this point nothing touches real capital, no paper or live brokers are involved, and the focus is on correctness and reproducibility.

Capabilities:

- **Stage 1 – Foundations & Architecture**
  - Repository and folder structure for Core ML, data, and SxE artifacts.
  - `core_ml_config` contract and environment modes (`offline`, `paper`, `live`).
  - Basic registries (e.g. `model_registry`, `backtests_index`) defined as schemas, even if sparsely populated at first.

- **Stage 2 – Data & Feature Pipeline**
  - Canonical schemas for price data, features, labels, and training datasets.
  - At least one complete feature framework (e.g. TREND_MTF) implemented end-to-end from raw data to ML-ready features.

- **Stage 3 – Modeling & Training**
  - Model families defined and registered.
  - The Model Registry implemented with at least one baseline model trained and logged.
  - Training pipelines and metrics are reproducible and re-runnable.

Outputs of Phase 1:

- The system can **train models offline**, reproduce experiments, and log results using consistent schemas.
- SxE integration points (registries & telemetry) exist, although UIs may still be minimal or stubbed.

Exit criteria:

- At least one model can be trained, evaluated, and re-trained from scratch using the defined pipelines and configs.
- Core schemas for data, features, and models are stable enough to support backtesting.

### 3. Phase 2 – Backtested Intelligence (Stage 4 + early SxE)

Phase 2 focuses on **turning models into decisions and decisions into trackable performance** via backtesting.

Capabilities:

- **Stage 4 – Backtesting & Evaluation**
  - Signal API contract defined and implemented.
  - Backtest configuration templates and a Backtests Index are in place.
  - Backtests can be executed reliably over historical data with controlled costs and slippage assumptions.
  - Backtest metrics are mapped into KPIs and preliminary promotion gates.

- Early SxE Integration:
  - Mirror surfaces basic backtest results (e.g. Sharpe, hit rate, max drawdown, TE).
  - Admin surfaces minimal controls over backtest profiles and thresholds (read-only or limited-write at first).

Outputs of Phase 2:

- IFNS can **simulate strategy behavior** over historical data and express performance in terms of well-defined KPIs.
- We have a first view of **what “good enough” looks like** to even consider paper execution.

Exit criteria:

- At least one model/strategy combination demonstrates repeatable backtest performance that satisfies initial KPI thresholds.
- The mapping from metrics → KPIs → gate outcomes is agreed and documented.

### 4. Phase 3 – Risk-Aware Execution Framework (Stage 5)

Phase 3 is where IFNS becomes capable of **risk-aware decision-making**, even before real-time execution is turned on. The goal is to make every action explainable under explicit policies.

Capabilities:

- **Stage 5 – Risk, Execution & SxE Link**
  - MSI context states and DRA decision tables are defined and tested against historical scenarios.
  - Risk envelopes, kill switch conditions, and cooldown rules are specified and validated through simulation.
  - Promotion and rollback policies are wired to backtest evidence and (later) paper/live KPIs.
  - Mirror and Admin start to expose these controls in operator-friendly form.

Outputs of Phase 3:

- A complete **control grid** exists: every key decision (trade, scale-up, promotion, rollback, halt) is governed by explicit rules and envelopes.
- We can explain, in structured form, under what conditions IFNS is allowed to act or must stand down.

Exit criteria:

- For a given hypothetical or historical scenario, the system can produce:
  - The **expected action** (or inaction),
  - The **policy or envelope** that justifies it,
  - The **telemetry evidence** that would be emitted.

At this point IFNS is structurally ready to act; it simply has not yet been allowed to touch even simulated markets in real time.

### 5. Phase 4 – Paper Intelligence (Stage 6)

Phase 4 introduces **paper trading**—full real-time execution behavior, but with simulated capital only.

Capabilities:

- **Stage 6 – Paper Trading**
  - A paper broker exists, consuming model signals and producing orders and fills.
  - Paper sessions are defined, with clear configuration and start/end markers.
  - Telemetry logs orders, fills, P&L, risk, events, and incidents for each session.
  - Mirror provides session-level dashboards; Admin provides controls to start/stop sessions and adjust paper-specific parameters.

Outputs of Phase 4:

- IFNS behaves as if live, but **no real capital is at risk**.
- We can see how models, MSI, DRA, and risk envelopes behave under streaming conditions.
- SEL begins gathering evidence from real-time behavior, not just backtests.

Exit criteria:

- A defined number of paper sessions (e.g. N weeks/days) completed, with:
  - Stable or improving performance metrics.
  - No uncontrolled risk breaches.
  - Incident handling and runbooks exercised at least once.

Phase 4 is the dress rehearsal: anything that surprises us here would have surprised us in live markets.

### 6. Phase 5 – Supervised Live Operations (Stage 7: Canary & Promoted)

Phase 5 moves IFNS into **real markets with real capital**, but under tightly controlled and supervised conditions.

Capabilities:

- **Stage 7 – Live Trading & Operations**
  - Live broker integrations are configured and tested with minimal capital.
  - Deployment lanes and environments define allowed transitions (offline → paper → live_canary → live_promoted).
  - Capital allocation plans enforce conservative slices for canary stages.
  - Incident types, runbooks, and the Change Log are fully operational.

The live deployment is staged:

1. **Live Canary** – limited capital, strict KPIs and risk tolerances, fast rollback conditions.
2. **Live Promoted** – expanded capital allocations once canary performance has been validated across sufficient scenarios and time.

Outputs of Phase 5:

- IFNS is an operating, live system with:
  - Clear visibility into risk and performance,
  - Governed policies and capital allocations,
  - A proven ability to respond to incidents.

Exit criteria:

- Successful live canary period(s) with no uncontained incidents.
- Promotion to a stable “live promoted” state for at least one strategy, with a documented Change Log trail.

### 7. Phase 6 – Continuous Evolution & Advanced Capabilities

The final phase is not an end-state; it is the **ongoing evolution loop**.

Capabilities:

- SEL is continuously ingesting evidence from backtests, paper, and live sessions.
- Models are retrained, retired, or added according to established policies.
- New feature frameworks, model families, and markets are introduced incrementally.
- Over time, more advanced capabilities—such as the “Advanced Awareness & Quantum Cognition” concepts of Step 14—are layered onto a stable foundation.

Outputs of Phase 6:

- IFNS remains **alive and adaptive** without losing stability or auditability.
- Each new enhancement declares its:
  - Internal mechanics,
  - SxE exposure,
  - Place in the evolutionary arc.

Phase 6 is perpetual; it is how IFNS avoids becoming static or brittle.

## 02 – Implementation Reference

The evolutionary arc described in this step is implemented and grounded by the **Seven-Step Master Plan** in the IFNS – Core ML Build Specification:

- **Phase 0 → Integrated Spec (Steps 1–14)**
  - Captured by the IFNS Integrated document itself, of which this step is a part.

- **Phase 1 → Foundations & Offline Core**
  - **Stage 1 – Foundations & Architecture**
  - **Stage 2 – Data & Feature Pipeline**
  - **Stage 3 – Modeling & Training**

- **Phase 2 → Backtested Intelligence**
  - **Stage 4 – Backtesting & Evaluation**
  - Early SxE integration for backtest KPIs and gate outcomes.

- **Phase 3 → Risk-Aware Execution Framework**
  - **Stage 5 – Risk, Execution & SxE Link**
  - MSI context states, DRA decision tables, risk envelopes, kill switch, cooldowns, and their SxE representations.

- **Phase 4 → Paper Intelligence**
  - **Stage 6 – Paper Trading**
  - Paper broker, sessions, telemetry, KPIs, and paper runbooks.

- **Phase 5 → Supervised Live Operations**
  - **Stage 7 – Live Trading & Operations**
  - Deployment lanes, live broker integration, capital allocation, incident taxonomy, and the Change Log.

- **Phase 6 → Continuous Evolution & Advanced Capabilities**
  - Implemented as repeated cycles across **Stages 3–7**, guided by SEL logic and promotion/rollback rules, and extended in future revisions to incorporate the advanced awareness concepts of Step 14.

In practice, each project milestone should map to:

1. A specific **Phase** in this evolutionary arc, and
2. The corresponding **Core ML Stage(s)** that must be completed or upgraded to move forward.

This ensures that evolution is **deliberate and evidence-based**, not ad-hoc.

## 03 – Notes & Decisions

- This step formalizes the IFNS evolution as **capability phases**, not dates, so it can be reused across different markets or deployments.
- The mapping Phase → Stage(s) is normative: any change to the Core ML Build Specification should preserve this alignment or explicitly update this step.
- When planning real-world roadmaps, this timeline can be annotated with:
  - Target durations for each phase,
  - Market-specific prerequisites (e.g., data availability, broker readiness),
  - External constraints (regulatory, infrastructure, or risk appetite).
