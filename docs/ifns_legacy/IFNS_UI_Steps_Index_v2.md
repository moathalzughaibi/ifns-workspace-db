# IFNS – UI Master: Steps Index

This index provides a single, high-level map of the **14 IFNS Integrated Steps** and their corresponding Markdown specs in the repo.
It is intended to mirror the structure of the **IFNS – UI Master** area in Notion.

> **Usage**
> - Each row corresponds to one Step (01–14).
> - `Spec File` is the Git source of truth.
> - `Core ML Stage Link` shows which Core ML build stages are most closely related.
> - `Status` tracks readiness of the written spec (not implementation status).
