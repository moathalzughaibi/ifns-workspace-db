# Phase 1 – IFNS 14-Step Master Spine & Hub/Child Structure

This handover file turns the **14-step IFNS – UI Master** into a clear spine with a consistent hub/child pattern,
so that future agents can reorganize Notion without deleting any content.

## 1. Canonical 14-step spine

The table below treats the 14 steps as the conceptual spine of IFNS. Each row maps the step to its Notion hub page and
to the Core ML build stages it primarily relates to.

## 2. Standard hub/child model for all steps

Each step already has three child pages linked from its hub:

- `01 – Narrative & Intent`
- `02 – Implementation Reference`
- `03 – Notes & Decisions`

To make the 14-step master easier to read and extend, keep this structure as the **baseline** and apply the following roles:

1. **Step Hub (this page)** – Index/landing page for the step. Keep only:

   - A short 3–5 line summary of what this step does.

   - A structured list of child pages (the three standard ones plus any future children).

2. **01 – Narrative & Intent** – Long-form explanation of *why* this step exists and how it fits into the overall IFNS story.

3. **02 – Implementation Reference** – Technical and operational detail: data flows, components, configs, and references into V2 / runtime.

4. **03 – Notes & Decisions** – Decision log, trade-offs, and historical notes; nothing should be deleted, only appended or clarified.


For long steps (most Narrative & Intent pages are 120–170 non-empty lines), future agents may additionally:

- Insert level-2 headings (`##`) inside `Narrative & Intent` to create **logical sections** (Context, Actors, Flows, Scenarios, Edge Cases).

- Or, when a section becomes independently important, split it into a **new child page**, linked from the hub under a fourth slot, e.g.:

  - `04 – UX & SxE Mirrors`
  - `04 – Telemetry & QC Anchors`
  - `04 – Runtime & Calendars`

The golden rule is: **never delete text**; instead, move or duplicate it into clearer child pages.

## 3. Per-step hub/child plan

For each step, this section describes how the existing pages should be treated and where future splits should happen.

### Step 01 – Preface Integration

- **Section key:** `Preface`
- **Step hub page:** `Private & Shared/Autopilot Hub/IFNS – UI Master/Step 01 – Preface Integration 2adb22c770d98068a351dc6f69822f3b.md`
- **Hub URL:** https://www.notion.so/2adb22c770d98068a351dc6f69822f3b
- **`01  Narrative & Intent` size:** ≈ 37 non-empty lines
- **Existing children (keep all):**
  - `01 – Narrative & Intent`
  - `02 – Implementation Reference`
  - `03 – Notes & Decisions`

**Recommended structure:**

1. Treat the current step page as a **pure hub** (no long body text; only summary + links).

2. Keep `Narrative & Intent` as the primary long-form document, but:

   - Introduce clear `##` sections: Context, Actors, Flows, Scenarios, Edge Cases.

   - When sections become very long, split them into new child pages (04/05…) and link them from the hub.

3. Keep `Implementation Reference` focused on structures that will later bind into V2 (indicators, telemetry, runtimes, catalogs).

4. Use `Notes & Decisions` strictly as a log (date-stamped bullets) so nothing is lost during future refactors.


**Step-specific notes:**
- Acts as the conceptual entry point for the entire IFNS; keep references broad and cross-cutting rather than technical.
