# Phase 3 – Telemetry, QC, Runtime & Calendar Wiring

This handover file turns the existing **Telemetry & QC**, **QCWeekly**, **CalendarGaps2025**, and **Runtime Templates** assets
into a coherent Notion-first structure that is clearly attached to the 14-step IFNS spine and UI Master V2 surfaces.
It assumes Phase 1 (14-step hubs) and Phase 2 (V2 attachments) are conceptually in place, but it can be applied independently.

## 2. Target Notion database designs

### 2.1 QCWeekly – Telemetry snapshots database

Create a **Notion database** called `QCWeekly` with the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `Name` | Title | Human-readable label for the snapshot (e.g. `QC – XNYS – H1 – Week 2025-11-28`). |
| `ts_week_end` | Date | Week end timestamp (from CSV). |
| `market` | Select / Text | Optional: exchange/venue label (derive from `view` or `notes` if needed). |
| `view` | Select | Logical view identifier (e.g. `H1_v1_0`). |
| `frequency` | Select | Sampling frequency (`1d`, `1h`, etc.). |
| `horizon` | Select | Horizon (`D1`, `H1`, etc.). |
| `row_count` | Number | Number of rows observed in the week. |
| `coverage_pct_mean` | Number (percent) | Mean feature coverage across the week. |
| `integrity_pct` | Number (percent) | Integrity score for the snapshot. |
| `max_na_pct_any_feature` | Number (percent) | Max NA rate across any feature. |
| `clip_budget_violations` | Number | Number of clipping budget breaches. |
| `clip_events_pct` | Number (percent) | Fraction of events affected by clipping. |
| `drift_alerts_count` | Number | Number of drift alerts fired. |
| `manifest_sha256` | Text | Manifest fingerprint used for this snapshot. |
| `family_breakdown` | Rich Text / JSON | Structured breakdown of families (CONTEXT, MICRO, etc.). |
| `notes` | Rich Text | Operator notes (e.g. holiday explanations). |
| `entry_id` | Text | Stable identifier from the telemetry payload. |
| `Step link` | Relation | Relation to the relevant **Step hub(s)** (07, 08, 09, 12, 13). |
| `V2 spec` | Relation | Relation to `Telemetry & QC` V2 spec card. |

**Views to configure in Notion:**

- `By Week`: Group by `ts_week_end`, filter last N weeks.

- `By Horizon`: Group by `horizon` and `view` to compare coverage and integrity across regimes.

- `Watchlist – Drift & Coverage`: Filter where `drift_alerts_count > 0` or `coverage_pct_mean < 0.98` or `clip_budget_violations > 0`.

- `Holiday / Special Weeks`: Filter on `notes` containing `Holiday`, `event`, or being non-empty.


**Row-page layout:**

- At the top of each row page, add a short summary block: `Week end, horizon, integrity, key issues.`

- Below, embed:

  - The raw JSON payload (if practical),

  - Links back to the **manifest** (via `manifest_sha256`) and any **Calendar gaps** for that week.


### 2.2 CalendarGaps2025 – Market schedule exceptions database

Create a **Notion database** called `CalendarGaps2025` with the following properties (mirroring the CSV):

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `event_id` | Title | Unique identifier (e.g. `gap-2025-01-01`). |
| `date` | Date | Date of the trading gap. |
| `market` | Select | Market/venue (e.g. `US`, `XNAS`, etc.). |
| `reason` | Text | Short reason (e.g. `Holiday • New Year`). |
| `notes` | Rich Text | Additional context (e.g. `No trading`, early close notes). |
| `Step link` | Relation | Relation to Step 04 (timeline), Step 09 (execution), and Step 12 (risk). |
| `Runtime link` | Relation | Relation to `Runtime – Calendar Gaps 2025` V2 spec card. |

**Views to configure in Notion:**

- `By Month`: Calendar view showing gaps by `date`.

- `By Market`: Table grouped by `market`.

- `Risk-Sensitive Gaps`: Filter where `reason` contains key phrases like `Holiday`, `Early close`, or `Unscheduled`.


### 2.3 Linking QCWeekly and CalendarGaps together

Once both DBs exist:

1. Add a relation from **QCWeekly → CalendarGaps2025** using `ts_week_end` and `date` proximity as the linking logic (operator-driven).

2. In QCWeekly row pages for special weeks (e.g. Thanksgiving), add links to the relevant `gap` rows from CalendarGaps.

3. In CalendarGaps row pages, embed a filtered view of QCWeekly constrained to the week of that gap.


## 3. Attach telemetry/runtime DBs to the 14-step spine

Use the following attachments between the databases and the Step hubs (as defined in Phase 1):

| Step | Role | Telemetry / Runtime attachments |

|-----:|------|----------------------------------|

| 04 | Preface Timeline / Evolution | Link to `Runtime Templates & Calendars` page + a filtered view of `CalendarGaps2025`. |

| 07 | Data Intelligence Layer (DIL) | Link to `Telemetry & QC` + main `QCWeekly` views (data health). |

| 08 | Modeling Intelligence (MI) | Same `QCWeekly` DB, filtered by modeling horizons; link drift/coverage metrics. |

| 09 | Execution Intelligence (EI) | Runtime surfaces (`Runtime Templates (YAML)`, `Runtime – Calendar Gaps 2025`) and QC snapshots affecting execution. |

| 12 | Decision & Risk Architecture (DRA) | `Watchlist – Drift & Coverage` view + high-risk calendar gaps. |

| 13 | Self-Evaluation & Learning (SEL) | Longitudinal `QCWeekly` trends, e.g. views over many weeks for learning loops. |


**Concrete instructions for the Notion agent:**

1. In each Step hub above, insert a `Telemetry & Runtime` section.

2. Embed the relevant Notion DB **views** there (not just links), so a reader can see live tables from QCWeekly and CalendarGaps2025.

3. Ensure that each QCWeekly and CalendarGaps row has its `Step link` relations set where appropriate (can be done gradually).


## 4. Tying DBs back to V2 spec cards

The V2 pages under `Telemetry & QC` and `Runtime Templates & Calendars` should become **spec cards** for these databases:

- `Telemetry & QC`: parent spec card for `QCWeekly` DB and any future telemetry DBs.

- `QC Weekly Schema v1`: documents the JSON schema; link it from the `QCWeekly` DB description and from the DB itself via a `Spec` relation.

- `QC Weekly Example v1`: example payloads; link similarly as sample data for implementers.

- `QC Weekly Telemetry V1 (Doc)`: narrative doc; embed links to both the DB and the schema.

- `QC Weekly ETL Skeleton / Clip Integration / ETL Script`: implementation notes; link from `Step 07` and `Step 08` hubs under implementation subsections.

- `Manifest I/O helpers`, `Manifest Diff Tool`, `CI IFNS Guard Workflow`, `CI Manifest Guard (Python)`: automation guards; link strongly from `Step 12 – DRA`.

- `Runtime Templates & Calendars`: parent spec card for both `CalendarGaps2025` DB and `Runtime Templates (YAML)` page.

- `Runtime – Calendar Gaps 2025`: narrative/doc spec for how calendar gaps feed runtime behavior; cross-linked from `CalendarGaps2025` DB.

- `Runtime Templates (YAML)`: implementation details for runtime jobs; link from `Step 09` and `Step 12` hubs and from any harness/mirror specs.


## 5. Implementation checklist for the Notion/Git agent

1. **Create/verify Notion DBs:**

   - `QCWeekly` DB with properties listed in §2.1.

   - `CalendarGaps2025` DB with properties listed in §2.2.

2. **Backfill records:**

   - Import the CSV rows into the corresponding DBs.

   - For QCWeekly, ensure the numeric fields (`coverage_pct_mean`, `integrity_pct`, etc.) use proper number/percent types.

3. **Configure core views:**

   - Add the `By Week`, `By Horizon`, `Watchlist – Drift & Coverage`, and `Holiday / Special Weeks` views for QCWeekly.

   - Add `By Month`, `By Market`, and `Risk-Sensitive Gaps` views for CalendarGaps2025.

4. **Wire DBs into Step hubs:**

   - For Steps 04, 07, 08, 09, 12, 13, embed the appropriate DB views under a `Telemetry & Runtime` section.

5. **Link spec cards:**

   - From each DB, add relations to the relevant V2 spec pages listed in §4.

   - From each V2 spec card, add back-links to the DBs (either via relations or inline links).

6. **Gradual enrichment:**

   - Over time, set the `Step link` relations on QCWeekly and CalendarGaps rows to match where they matter most.

   - Do not delete or overwrite any existing Notion pages; only add structure, relations, and views.
