# Phase 4 – Catalog & Feature Universe Surfaces

This handover file focuses on the **CatalogL1 / CatalogL2L3** assets and their related feature-schema spec cards
under `Manifests & Policy` in IFNS – UI Master (V2). It defines how to turn them into coherent Notion databases,
and how to attach them to the 14-step IFNS spine without deleting or overwriting any existing content.

## 2. Target Notion database design – Feature Catalog

Instead of treating `CatalogL1` and `CatalogL2L3` as separate, opaque tables, we define a unified **Feature Catalog**
Notion database that can still preserve the notion of levels (L1 vs L2/L3) but feels like a single universe.

### 2.1 Unified Feature Catalog DB

Create a Notion database called `Feature Catalog` with the following properties (mapped from the CSV columns):

| Property | Type | Source | Description |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| `Name` | Title | `name` / `Name` | Human-readable indicator / framework name. |
| `indicator_id` | Text | `indicator_id` | Stable machine identifier (used in code & manifests). |
| `level` | Select | `level` or inferred | Indicator level (`L1`, `L2`, `L3`). For CatalogL1 rows, set `L1`; for CatalogL2L3 rows, use `level` column. |
| `digitization_level` | Select | `digitization_level` | How formalized the spec is (formula/rule/state_machine/ML, etc.). |
| `family_role_primary` | Select | `family_role_primary` | Primary family role (e.g. `Trend & Price Location`). |
| `family_role_secondary` | Multi-select | `family_role_secondary` | Secondary roles (e.g. `Market Structure & Geometry`). |
| `ml_role_primary` | Select | `ml_role_primary` | Primary ML role (`feature`, `context`, `target`, `filter`, etc.). |
| `ml_role_secondary` | Multi-select | `ml_role_secondary` | Secondary ML roles (comma-split when imported). |
| `output_type_primary` | Select | `output_type_primary` | Main output type (`scalar`, `vector`, `state`, `event`, etc.). |
| `feature_outputs_default` | Text / JSON | `feature_outputs_default` | Default feature outputs (value/state/events flags). |
| `inputs` | Text | `inputs` | Required input domains (e.g. `price`, `volume`, `hlc3`). |
| `required_fields` | Text | `required_fields` | Specific fields required from the feed (e.g. `close`, `high`, `low`). |
| `default_timeframes` | Text | `default_timeframes` | JSON-like list of default timeframes (e.g. `["1h","1d"]`). |
| `default_params` | Text | `default_params` | JSON-like object of parameters (e.g. `{ "window": 20 }`). |
| `dependencies_L1` | Text | `dependencies_L1` (L2/L3 only) | Upstream L1 indicators used by this L2/L3 framework. |
| `dependencies_external` | Text | `dependencies_external` | External dependencies if any. |
| `construction_type` | Select | `construction_type` (L2/L3) | Construction style (`state_machine`, `composite`, etc.). |
| `output_components` | Text / JSON | `output_components` (L2/L3) | Named outputs for multi-component frameworks. |
| `pattern_window` | Text | `pattern_window` | Window/lag structure if applicable. |
| `state_space_def` | Text | `state_space_def` | State definitions for stateful indicators. |
| `universe_tier` | Select | `universe_tier` (L2/L3) | Tiering for inclusion in default universes. |
| `notes_phase3` / `notes_phase4` | Rich Text | `notes_phase3` / `notes_phase4` | Notes by phase; can be merged into a single rich-text property. |
| `Step link` | Relation | manual | Relation to the relevant Step hubs (07, 08, 10, 12). |
| `Spec cards` | Relation | manual | Relation to V2 spec pages (Feature Schema, Family Map, Policy Matrix, etc.). |

**Views to configure in Notion:**

- `By Level`: Group by `level` so L1 / L2 / L3 frameworks are clearly separated.

- `By Family`: Group by `family_role_primary` (e.g. Trend, Volatility, Market Structure, etc.).

- `By ML Role`: Group by `ml_role_primary` to see which features feed which stages (context vs signal vs control).

- `Universe – Tiered`: Filter by `universe_tier` to show only the default live-ready universe.


**Row-page layout suggestions:**

- Top section: a short prose description (from `notes_phase3/4`).

- Middle section: a table or bullet list of:

  - `indicator_id`, `inputs`, `default_params`, `default_timeframes`.

  - `family_role_primary/secondary`, `ml_role_primary/secondary`.

- Bottom section: links to **Feature Schema**, **Family Map**, **Policy Matrix** rows for this feature (via `Spec cards`).


## 3. Attach Feature Catalog to the 14-step spine

Use the following mapping between the Feature Catalog and the Step hubs (from Phase 1):

| Step | Role | Feature Catalog usage |

|-----:|------|------------------------|

| 07 | Data Intelligence Layer (DIL) | Primary home for Feature Catalog views (by family, by level). |

| 08 | Modeling Intelligence (MI) | Filtered views for `ml_role_primary in {feature, target}` and modeling-relevant tiers. |

| 10 | Market Structural Awareness (MSA) | Views focused on `family_role_primary = Market Structure & Geometry` and related features. |

| 12 | Decision & Risk Architecture (DRA) | Views filtered by features that act as risk controls, guardrails, or governance inputs. |


**Concrete instructions for the Notion agent:**

1. In **Step 07 – DIL hub**, create a `Feature Catalog` section and embed the main `By Level` and `By Family` views.

2. In **Step 08 – MI hub**, embed a `Features for Modeling` view filtered on modeling roles.

3. In **Step 10 – MSA hub**, embed a `Market Structure Features` view filtered on family roles.

4. In **Step 12 – DRA hub**, embed a `Risk & Control Features` view filtered on ML roles and/or tagged via `universe_tier`.


## 4. Link Feature Catalog rows to V2 spec cards

The V2 pages under `Manifests & Policy` act as **spec cards** for the Feature Catalog. The relationships should be:

- `Indicator Feature Schema v1 (with family)` → Column-level schema for features, with family tags.

- `Indicator Feature Schema H1 v1 (with family)` → Time-horizon-specific schema variant.

- `Feature Policy Matrix` → Mapping of features to risk/usage constraints and policy flags.

- `Feature Family Map` → Canonical mapping between indicator families, roles, and higher-level groupings.

- `Universe Catalog (Phase 2 Draft)` → Early draft of the live universe; feeds into `universe_tier`.

- `Indicators – L1 Catalog (Phase 3)` → CSV-backed spec aligned with CatalogL1.

- `Indicators – L2/L3 Framework Catalog (Phase 4)` → CSV-backed spec aligned with CatalogL2L3.


**Relations in Notion:**

- Each **Feature Catalog row** should have a `Spec cards` relation to one or more of these V2 pages.

- Conversely, each V2 spec card can have a rollup/list of related Feature Catalog rows.


**Page-level notes for the Notion agent:**

- `Indicator Feature Schema v1 (with family)` — keep this as a **read-only spec card**; do not paste full table data here.
  - Instead, ensure the underlying CSV is mirrored into the `Feature Catalog` DB or a companion DB,
    and let this page serve as the documentation and context for those fields.

- `Indicator Feature Schema H1 v1 (with family)` — keep this as a **read-only spec card**; do not paste full table data here.
  - Instead, ensure the underlying CSV is mirrored into the `Feature Catalog` DB or a companion DB,
    and let this page serve as the documentation and context for those fields.

- `Feature Policy Matrix` — keep this as a **read-only spec card**; do not paste full table data here.
  - Instead, ensure the underlying CSV is mirrored into the `Feature Catalog` DB or a companion DB,
    and let this page serve as the documentation and context for those fields.

- `Feature Family Map` — keep this as a **read-only spec card**; do not paste full table data here.
  - Instead, ensure the underlying CSV is mirrored into the `Feature Catalog` DB or a companion DB,
    and let this page serve as the documentation and context for those fields.

- `Indicators – Universe Catalog (Phase 2 Draft)` — keep this as a **read-only spec card**; do not paste full table data here.
  - Instead, ensure the underlying CSV is mirrored into the `Feature Catalog` DB or a companion DB,
    and let this page serve as the documentation and context for those fields.

- `Indicators – L1 Catalog (Phase 3)` — keep this as a **read-only spec card**; do not paste full table data here.
  - Instead, ensure the underlying CSV is mirrored into the `Feature Catalog` DB or a companion DB,
    and let this page serve as the documentation and context for those fields.

- `Indicators – L2 L3 Framework Catalog (Phase 4)` — keep this as a **read-only spec card**; do not paste full table data here.
  - Instead, ensure the underlying CSV is mirrored into the `Feature Catalog` DB or a companion DB,
    and let this page serve as the documentation and context for those fields.


## 5. Handling existing CatalogL1 / CatalogL2L3 row pages

The export contains many `Untitled …` row pages under `CatalogL1` and `CatalogL2L3`. To avoid losing history:

1. **Do not delete** any of these pages.

2. For each row page:

   - Link it to the corresponding **Feature Catalog row** (using a relation like `Legacy row page`).

   - Optionally, add a short note at the top: `Superseded by Feature Catalog row XYZ but kept for history`.

3. Over time, new edits should happen on the Feature Catalog row pages, not on the old `Untitled` cards.


## 6. Implementation checklist for the Notion/Git agent

1. **Create the unified `Feature Catalog` DB** with properties listed in §2.1.

2. **Import CSVs:**

   - Import `CatalogL1 … .csv` and `CatalogL2L3 … .csv` into this DB (or into two staging DBs, then merge).

   - Ensure `indicator_id` is preserved exactly; this is the stable key.

   - Derive `level` as `L1` for rows coming from CatalogL1 and use the `level` column for CatalogL2L3.

3. **Normalize select / multi-select fields:**

   - Normalize `family_role_primary`, `family_role_secondary`, `ml_role_primary`, `ml_role_secondary`, `digitization_level` into consistent select options.

4. **Configure views:**

   - Implement the `By Level`, `By Family`, `By ML Role`, and `Universe – Tiered` views.

5. **Attach to Step hubs:**

   - Embed the appropriate views in the Step 07, 08, 10, and 12 hubs as described in §3.

6. **Wire spec cards:**

   - For each of the V2 spec pages in §4, add relations to the Feature Catalog rows and vice versa.

7. **Preserve legacy row pages:**

   - Create a relation from Feature Catalog rows back to the old `CatalogL1` / `CatalogL2L3` cards.

   - Mark those cards explicitly as historical / legacy in their page headers.

8. **No deletions:**

   - At no point should existing content be deleted. The work is purely additive and relational.
