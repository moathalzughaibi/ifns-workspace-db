# IFNS – UI Master Summary

This page provides a concise overview of the **IFNS – UI Master** specification and its current coverage status.

---

## 1. Purpose

The **IFNS – UI Master** is the **top-level narrative and structural specification** for the Intelligent Financial Neural System (IFNS). It ties together:

- The 14-step Integrated IFNS document (conceptual and operational blueprint).
- The Core ML Build stages (0–7) that define how the system is implemented.
- The SxE (System-to-Experience) philosophy: Mirror, Admin, telemetry, and registries.

Everything in this area is **Git-backed** and synchronized to Notion so that:

- Git is the **source of truth** for specs and version control.
- Notion provides the **operational workspace** for reading, navigation, and discussion.

## 2. Current Coverage (v0.6)

### 2.1 IFNS 14-Step Integrated Spec

All 14 Steps now exist as Markdown specs under `docs/ifns/`:

- **Preface & Overview**
  - Step 01 – Preface Integration
  - Step 02 – Executive Summary
  - Step 03 – Visionary–Technical Overview
  - Step 04 – Preface Timeline – Evolutionary Arc

- **Foundations & Architecture**
  - Step 05 – Introduction — Operational Genesis Framework
  - Step 06 – System Architecture

- **Core Intelligence Layers**
  - Step 07 – Data Intelligence Layer (DIL)
  - Step 08 – Modeling Intelligence (MI)
  - Step 09 – Execution Intelligence (EI)
  - Step 10 – Market Structural Awareness (MSA)
  - Step 11 – Model & Signal Integration (MSI)
  - Step 12 – Decision & Risk Architecture (DRA)
  - Step 13 – Self-Evaluation & Learning (SEL)

- **Advanced Layer**
  - Step 14 – Advanced Awareness & Quantum Cognition

Each Step follows the same pattern:

1. **Narrative & Intent**
2. **Implementation Reference** (how it maps to Core ML stages and artifacts)
3. **Notes & Decisions**

All are currently marked as **Draft v0.6** (language and structure stable enough for use, but open for refinement as the build progresses).

### 2.2 Core ML Build Stages (0–7)

In parallel, a separate set of specs (to be developed in Phase 3) will capture the **Core ML Build stages**:

- Stage 00 – Document Overview
- Stage 01 – Foundations & Architecture
- Stage 02 – Data & Feature Pipeline
- Stage 03 – Modeling & Training
- Stage 04 – Backtesting & Evaluation
- Stage 05 – Risk, Execution & SxE Link
- Stage 06 – Paper Trading
- Stage 07 – Live Trading & Operations

These stages will be cross-linked with the 14 Steps using the **Steps Index** (this repo) and corresponding Notion pages.

## 3. Navigation & Usage

A typical navigation flow for readers:

1. **Start from this Summary**
   - Understand the big picture and which parts of IFNS are covered.

2. **Use the Steps Index**
   - Jump to any Step’s detailed spec.
   - See which Core ML stages it relates to.

3. **Dive into Step Specs (01–14)**
   - Read narrative → implementation reference → notes.
   - Use links into:
     - Admin & UI Matrix,
     - Telemetry schemas,
     - Core ML Stage specs (once Phase 3 is wired).

4. **Use Drafts & Working Notes**
   - Track ongoing edits, open questions, and design discussions that have not yet been merged into the main specs.

As the build progresses, this area becomes the **anchor for system-level understanding** of IFNS.

## 4. Next Focus Areas

For the next phases of work, this is the planned focus:

1. **Phase 2 (this phase)**
   - Establish Git-backed:
     - Steps Index (this repo),
     - Summary (this page),
     - Drafts & Working Notes (log of ongoing spec edits).

2. **Phase 3**
   - Create Core ML Stage specs (0–7) as Markdown, Git-backed, and synced to Notion.
   - Wire cross-links between Steps and Stages (both in Markdown and Notion).

3. **Phase 4**
   - Introduce CSV-backed Notion databases for:
     - Feature catalogs,
     - Model registries,
     - Backtests index,
     - Telemetry schema and examples,
     - Risk envelope and promotion rules dictionaries.

This roadmap keeps narrative/spec work ahead of implementation so that all future code and UI work is anchored in a stable, evolving **IFNS – UI Master**.
