# Step 01 – Preface Integration Narrative Split Kit

This file helps you break the **`01 Narrative & Intent`** page for **Step 01 – Preface Integration**

into smaller child pages in Notion. All content below is taken from your existing Notion export and regrouped

by headings only (no new concepts added).


## A. Parent page – `01 Narrative & Intent` (new layout)

In Notion, keep `01 Narrative & Intent` as a short overview and index page. Replace its body with something like:

```markdown
# 01 – Narrative & Intent

This step introduces IFNS as a **living system** and connects the visionary narrative

to the operational blueprint. It sets the mental model for the rest of the 14-step

spine and anchors the idea of the interface as a **Mirror of Financial Awareness**,

not just a traditional dashboard.


Use this page as a **map** only. The detailed guidance now lives in the child pages below.

## Child pages

1. **Preface – 1. What this step does**
2. **Preface – 2. Who this step is for**
3. **Preface – 3. Key messages (must survive in all versions)**
4. **Preface – 4. Success criteria for Step 01**

Each child page should appear as a Notion subpage under this one.
```

## B. Child pages (copy each into its own Notion page)


### B.1 `Preface – 1. What this step does`

```markdown
# Preface – 1. What this step does

- Introduces **IFNS (Intelligent Financial Neural System)** as a living system, not just a tool.
- Connects the **Visionary narrative** (why IFNS exists) with the **Operational blueprint** (how it behaves in practice).
- Sets the mental model for all later steps (DIL, MI, EI, MSI, DRA, SEL, Awareness layers).
- Establishes the idea that the interface is a **Mirror of Financial Awareness**, not a traditional dashboard.
```

### B.2 `Preface – 2. Who this step is for`

```markdown
# Preface – 2. Who this step is for

- Executive / strategic readers who want to understand *what IFNS is* in one place.
- Senior engineers and designers who need a shared big-picture before diving into architecture or UI details.
- Future operators who will use the **Admin Console** and **Awareness Mirror** but are not ML or infra experts.
```

### B.3 `Preface – 3. Key messages (must survive in all versions)`

```markdown
# Preface – 3. Key messages (must survive in all versions)

- IFNS is designed as a **neural system** with:
  - **Data Intelligence Layer (DIL)**  sensory cortex (what the system sees and trusts).
  - **Modeling Intelligence (MI)**  cognitive heart (how the system thinks and learns).
  - **Execution Intelligence (EI)**  motor system (how the system acts in markets).
  - **Awareness layers (TAC, MCEE, GMCL, QDA, SEL)**  meta-awareness and self-critique.
- The systems interface (UX) is the *visible reflection* of this inner structure:
  - Admin = control center and safety layer.
  - Awareness Mirror = narrative and visualization of system state.

  - Dashboards = curated windows into behaviour, risk, and learning.
- IFNS must be:
  - **Controllable** (operators can switch modes, adjust policies, and stop it safely).
  - **Explainable** (core decisions can be traced to clear signals, models, and constraints).
  - **Upgradeable** (new models, data feeds, and tactics can be added without chaos).
```

### B.4 `Preface – 4. Success criteria for Step 01`

```markdown
# Preface – 4. Success criteria for Step 01

This step is done when:

- A non-technical executive can read this step in Notion and say:
  - I understand what IFNS is supposed to be in my organization.
- Designers and engineers can:
  - Reuse this narrative as the **intro section** in slide decks, docs, and onboarding.
  - Trace every later UI/console element back to concepts introduced here.
- The language here does **not** conflict with:
  - The Integrated IFNS Master document.
  - The Admin & UI Matrix.
  - The operational 14-step master plan.
