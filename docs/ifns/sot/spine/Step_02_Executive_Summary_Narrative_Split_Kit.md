# Step 02 – Executive Summary Narrative Split Kit

This file helps you break the **`01 Narrative & Intent`** page for **Step 02 – Executive Summary**

into smaller child pages in Notion. All content below is taken from your existing Notion export and regrouped

by headings only (no new concepts added).


## A. Parent page – `01 Narrative & Intent` (new layout)

In Notion, keep `01 Narrative & Intent` as a short overview and index page. Replace its body with something like:

```markdown
# 01 – Narrative & Intent

This step defines the **executive summary** for IFNS.

It distills the full concept into a concise story that explains what IFNS is, why it is being built,

how it broadly works, what success looks like, and how it will be operated safely.


Use this page as a **map** only. The detailed guidance now lives in the child pages below.

## Child pages

1. **Exec – 1. What this step does**
2. **Exec – 2. Audience**
3. **Exec – 3. Key bullets that must always appear**
4. **Exec – 4. Summary structure**

Each child page should appear as a Notion subpage under this one.
```

## B. Child pages (copy each into its own Notion page)


### B.1 `Exec – 1. What this step does`

```markdown
# Exec – 1. What this step does

- Distills the **full IFNS concept** into a short, structured executive summary.
- Explains:
  - What IFNS is (at the product/system level).
  - Which major components it has (DIL, MI, EI, MSI, DRA, SEL, Awareness layers).
  - How it will be controlled and observed (Admin Console, Awareness Mirror).
- Connects **business outcomes** (risk-adjusted returns, stability, governance)  
  with **technical strategy** (ML models, telemetry, backtesting, paper/live).
```

### B.2 `Exec – 2. Audience`

```markdown
# Exec – 2. Audience

- Executives and sponsors (risk, operations, investment, technology).
- Senior engineers / data scientists who need a quick big picture.
- Any external partner or provider who needs context before deeper specs.
```

### B.3 `Exec – 3. Key bullets that must always appear`

```markdown
# Exec – 3. Key bullets that must always appear

- IFNS is designed as an **intelligent financial neural system** that:
  - Ingests and validates data (Data Intelligence Layer  DIL).
  - Learns from markets (Modeling Intelligence  MI).
  - Executes and monitors trades (Execution Intelligence  EI).
  - Integrates multiple signals (Model & Signal Integration  MSI).
  - Makes decisions under risk constraints (Decision & Risk Architecture  DRA).
  - Evaluates itself over time (Self-Evaluation & Learning  SEL).
  - Surfaces higher-order awareness (TAC, MCEE, GMCL, QDA).
- The interface is **not just a dashboard**:
  - It is a **Mirror of Financial Awareness**, showing:
    - State of the system,
    - Health of models and data,

    - Readiness for deployment,
    - Key risks and incidents.
- Control and governance:
  - A central **IFNS Admin Console** manages defaults, toggles, and critical policies.
  - A **Default Parameters Registry** tracks all thresholds and timings.
  - Observability is built-in from day one (logs, metrics, incidents, snapshots, narrative AI).
```

### B.4 `Exec – 4. Summary structure`

```markdown
# Exec – 4. Summary structure

A suggested executive summary layout:

1. **What IFNS is**  
   - A neural system for financial decision-making and automation.
2. **Why it is being built**  
   - Improve decision quality, stability, and transparency vs. ad-hoc/manual trading.
3. **How it works (at a high level)**  
   - Data  Models  Decisions  Execution  Learning & Awareness.
4. **What success looks like**  
   - Stable risk-adjusted performance, explainable behavior, controlled risk,  
     fast iteration with strong guardrails.
5. **How it will be operated safely**  
   - Clear control panel, incident logging, readiness scoring, and human override.
